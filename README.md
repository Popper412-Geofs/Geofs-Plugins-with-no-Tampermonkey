# Geofs-Plugins-with-no-Tampermonkey
I have copied and pasted some of my favorite Geofs Plugins with NO Tampermonkey. Please check out these mods and these creators. I'll have them in the description. Also. To put these INTO GeoFS. You need to access the Console. You do this by pressing (Ctrl+Shift+i). Without the parenthesis though. Then once yyou're in the console, you wanna press the Console button. Then once you did that, you now have to type 'allow pasting' twice. WITH the ' at both sides. And once u did that, You now copy and paste these plugins into the console.


DISCLAIMER: I do not own ANY of these. So don't say they're mine. I just put all of them into one page so you don't have to keep looking to find good ones. This way ONLY works on laptop and computer if you have chrome and on a windows laptop/computer. I don't know if it's the same way on a Macbook (Pro) or any other PC/Laptops.
